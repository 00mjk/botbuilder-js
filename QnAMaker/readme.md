## Configuration
A configuration object is required to provide the endpoint base path, app ID, version ID and the 
authoring key to each outbound call. There are 3 ways to provide this information to the cli

1. As a `.qnamakerrc` file in the cwd. 
The json format for the `.qnamakerrc` file is:
```json
{
  "knowledgeBaseID": "xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx",
  "subscriptionKey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "endpointBasePath": "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/qnamaker/v2.0"
}
```

> NOTE: Simply run `qnamaker --init` to answer simple questions to create your .qnamakerrc file

2. As arguments to the cli. `--kbid <string> --subscriptionKey <string> --endpointBasePath <string>`

3. As environment variables. `QNAMAKER_KBID, QNAMAKER_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY, QNAMAKER_ENDPOINT_BASE_PATH`

The cli will first look for these named configuration variables in the arguments list, then inside the `.qnamakerrc` file, then fallback to environment variables. 

### Securing Your Access Key
To better secure your access key, it's recommended to omit the key from the `.qnamakerrc` 
file and instead pass it in to the `--subscriptionKey` argument or store it as the `QNAMAKER_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` 
environment variable. If security is not a concern for your particular case, all configuration items 
can be stored in the `.qnamaker` for convenience.

### Overriding Configurations
Since configuration items can be passed as arguments to the cli, using arguments to specify 
the configuration will override the `.qnamakerrc` and any environment variables that may have been specified.
